#Welcome to My GitHub Profile!
Hello there 👋 Welcome to my GitHub repository. I'm a passionate front-end developer who's just started diving into 
the exciting world of web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This repository is a reflection of my 
learning journey, where you'll find projects and code related to my exploration of these technologies. 
Additonally I am studying UIC IT Academy "LEVEL UP" course 

##About Me
I'm a budding developer eager to create visually appealing and interactive web experiences. As of now, 
I'm focusing on honing my skills in front-end development, gradually expanding my knowledge and proficiency.

🌱 Currently upgrading my knowledge and practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and in next month I will start Vue.js.
💡 Interested in Vue.js and Next.js
🎨 Enthusiastic about crafting engaging and responsive web designs.

##Repository Contentes 
Here's a glimpse of what you can expect to find in this repository:

###Project
I'll be sharing various projects that demonstrate my progress in front-end development. 
These projects will showcase my grasp of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js and Next.js concepts.

###Learning Resources
As I'm on a learning journey, I'll also curate a list of helpful resources that 
have aided me in understanding and implementing web development techniques.
-[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths) is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources. 
Not everyone has access to a computer science education or the funds to attend an intensive 
coding school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway. This project is designed to 
fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it on their own but still want a high quality education.
Get in Touch
I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers, learners, and anyone who's interested 
in the world of front-end development. Feel free to reach out to me through my [email](sardornext@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sardor-kh-bb6782284/).

Let's learn and grow together! 🚀

Thank you for stopping by and checking out my GitHub profile. Your feedback and suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Happy coding! 😄

Best regards,
Sardor
